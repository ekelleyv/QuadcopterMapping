NOTE: USING STATE UPDATE 2, MEANING X AND Y STATES AREN"T BEING UPDATED IN THE DRONE!

yaw:
	try to make the yaw controller gain higher to lower drift - turn up gain as far as possible until oscillation happens
	trial1: gain at 3, desired is 5
	trial2: gain is at 3, desired is 170
	trial3: desired is -50
	trial4: turned up to 3.5, could do -5 without moving essentially
	trial5: desired is -50
	trial6: desired is 120
	trial7: desired is 7, -12, 5
	trial8: desired is 15, 160, -5

turned up gain until the drone could hit -5 without drifting



z: 
	trial1: desired is 1000 at original gain
	trial2: turn up gain to 0.5
	trial3: turned up gain to 0.75
	trial4: try 2000 as desired, no drift!
	trial5: 1000, 500, 1500
switched to update type 0
	trial6: 1000, 1500, 2000 - so pretty!



sine: 
	trial1: sine wave using update type 0, really not bad, distances clearly off
	trial2: more waypoints, really good! 
	trial3: using update type 1, pretty awful


x
	trial1: x = 1000
	trial2: x = 500, -400, 1000


star:
	trial1: star flight, mode 0, pretty successful :D
	trial2: SO GOOD!
	trial3: record - not as good as last one, but okay
	trial4: use state estimation, lots of drift, record


square: 	
	trial1: with navdata update type 0, scales really small (distances clealry off), didn't start and end at rigth place
	trial2: larger scales, pretty well, some oscillations but wow
	trial3: try with tum_ardrone x and y measurements, wetn crazy, forget this 

spiral:
	trial1: try figure 8 pattern! mode 0, hit all the waypoints, looked so goood!, recorded
	trial2: mode 3, drift towards end
	trial3: try again with larger values, drifted, recorded
	trial4: try again with mode 3





squareHead: square but change the heading
	trial1: wow that's really bad
	trial2: tried only 2 points, turn stay for 0.1s, then move and hover, drift is bad in gyro - use filtered data? need filtered data.tried turning up gain for this one but it didn't help





circle: 
	trial1: got to point 3, got very very very lost
	trial2: good until point 4 or so...
